Reporting API (deprecated)
==========================
This API gives access to your analytics reports.

.. deprecated:: 9.0
    On September 20, 2020 this API will be disabled on the cloud. Customers using PPAS on-premises will get it disabled with the next upgrade to 9.0 LTS or higher.
    The :ref:`Analytics tracking API <tracking-api-http>` will remain as is. We recommend you to switch to :ref:`Analytics (new) report API<custom-reports-http-api>` as soon as possible. For more info, see the `API migration guide <https://help.piwik.pro/support/migrate/analytics-new-api-migration-guide/>`_.

A short description of all available reports is available in :term:`Analytics`. Follow these instructions to access it:

#. Login into your PPAS instance
#. Go to `Menu` > `Analytics settings`.
