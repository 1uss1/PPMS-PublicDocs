  summary: Track attributes
  description: |
    <p>In order to enrich the profile with more attributes specific to your needs or business requirements, you can use that endpoint to send custom attribute_name-value pairs which will be saved in the profile. It can be anything you wish but remember that values are always saved as a string. For example, you can send a favourite_food attribute to profiles and later on create an audience of people who like Italian food.</p>
    <p>You can send data in batches - multiple profiles in one request and multiple attributes in the profile. All of the data in one batch request should be related to websites that belong to the same organization.</p>
    <p>Each item must have at least one of identifiers (<code>user_id</code> or <code>email</code> or <code>analytics_visitor_id</code> or <code>device_id</code>).</p>
